# Crypto Price Tracker (starter)

This repo is scaffolded as a crypto price tracker.

Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- CoinGecko API (price data)
- Chart.js for simple charts (added later)

Local setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

Defaults in this scaffold
- Top 20 coins
- Auto-refresh every 30s
- Coin detail page with 7/30 day chart (to be added)

What I will do after your approval
- Push the scaffold to branch `scaffold/nextjs-ts-tailwind`
- Open a PR to `main` with notes and TODO issues
- Add a coin detail page and Chart.js integration in follow-up PRs
